# AD Tool

A quick reference tool for Antimatter Dimensions Eternity Challenges.

## Purpose

When playing Antimatter Dimensions and working through Eternity Challenges (ECs), players need to frequently look up which Time Study splits to use. This tool provides a clear, compact view of the recommended splits for each challenge.

## Key Concepts

### Eternity Challenges
- 12 challenges (EC1-EC12), each completed 5 times (x1-x5)
- Each completion has recommended Time Theorems (TT) and Time Studies (TS)

### Dimension Split (TS 71-103)
Choose one path:
- **Antimatter** (71, 81, 91, 101) - Green
- **Infinity** (72, 82, 92, 102) - Orange
- **Time** (73, 83, 93, 103) - Purple

### Pace Split (TS 121-141)
Choose one path:
- **Active** (121, 131, 141) - Red
- **Passive** (122, 132, 142) - Purple
- **Idle** (123, 133, 143) - Blue

## Data Source

Strategy data from the Antimatter Dimensions community spreadsheet (Picturemap v2.6).
